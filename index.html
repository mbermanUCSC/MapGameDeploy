            <p>Looking for a job that's a bit off the beaten path? Literally. We're on the hunt for someone bold enough, or perhaps just sufficiently curious (or crazy), to map out a city that can't sit still. By night, it's an eerie maze where buildings can't sit still. By day? Well, it's still a maze, but slightly less eerie and more... navigable? 
            When the sun goes down, it's your job to help map the city and help make it livable again. Think of yourself as a cartographic entrepreneur with a flair for the nocturnal and mysterious. You'll be the unsung hero guiding daytime adventurers, citygoers, and probably a few lost pizza delivery folks. So, if you're ready to trade in your desk job, we've got a pen, map, and a flashlight with your name on it.</p>
